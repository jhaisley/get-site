here!](/change-log/pay-per-event-a-new-pricing-model-is-out)\n\nNew\n\nActor\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to introduce a major update on how developers monetize their Actors on Apify - **pay per event.** This new pricing model gives both developers and users more **transparency, flexibility, and fairness** in how Actors are charged and used.\n\n### What is pay per event pricing?\n\nWith **pay per event (PPE)** , developers can charge based on specific events triggered during an Actor‚Äôs run - such as starting an Actor, scraping a page, or calling an API. Unlike **pay per result (PPR)** , which charges users based on the number of dataset items produced, **pay per event** lets developers define their own chargeable events.\n\n### Why is pay per event the future of Apify pricing?\n\nWhen using a PPE Actor, you will\n\n  * know exactly **what you‚Äôre being charged for**.\n  * have a fairer pricing model for **integration and AI-driven** use cases, where dataset-based pricing doesn‚Äôt make sense.\n  * have the ability to **set a maximum budget per run** , preventing unexpected costs.\n\n\n\nWith PPE, developers can benefit from\n\n  * charging users for different parts of an Actor‚Äôs functionality.\n  * passing on the costs of **external APIs or additional processing** directly to users.\n  * avoiding revenue loss from small but usage-heavy runs that wouldn‚Äôt be profitable under PPR.\n  * **expanding use cases beyond scraping** ; integrations or AI-agents, to name just a few.\n\n\n\n### Ready to try pay per event?\n\nPPE is now live! Whether you‚Äôre a developer looking for a fairer way to monetize your Actor or a user who wants more transparency in pricing, PPE is built for you.\n\n  * Developers: You can now develop new Actors or switch your existing Actors to PPE. **If you publish a new PPE Actor by March 31, 2025, we will charge a 0% commission for the first 6 months.**\n  * Users: Look for [PPE Actors on Apify Store](https://apify.com/store/categories?pricing=PAY_PER_EVENT).\n\n\n\nYou can find more details on pay per event [here](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/actors-in-store#pay-per-event).\n\nYou can also join our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU) to share your experience with building PPE Actors with other developers.\n\nFilip Cicv√°rek\n\nSenior Product Manager\n\n* * *\n\nFeb 19, 2025\n\n## [Introducing OpenAPI schema definition and Apify community forum](/change-log/openapi-schema-and-apify-community-forum)\n\nNew\n\nActor\n\nWeb\n\n## Actors now have OpenAPI schema definition\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to announce that all Apify actors can now be accessed using OpenAPI. The OpenAPI definition makes it easy for users to communicate or integrate the Actors programmatically.\n\n### What is OpenAPI schema?\n\nThe Apify API lets you interact with Actors programmatically using Python, JavaScript, or HTTP through a standardized OpenAPI interface. Trigger Actors, monitor runs, and retrieve data programmatically. The API makes it simple to integrate Actors into automated workflows.\n\n### Why OpenAPI?\n\nAs Apify expands its AI agents and Actors, OpenAPI is the backbone for easily integrating Actors into your systems. It simplifies interactions and automation, allowing you to build faster and more reliably.\n\n### Try Actor-specific OpenAPI\n\nGet started by downloading the OpenAPI definition for any Apify Actor. Here‚Äôs an example for üìç [Google Maps Email Extractor](https://apify.com/lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details/api/openapi)\n\nLearn more in our [blog post](https://blog.apify.com/add-custom-actions-to-your-gpts).\n\n## Introducing the Apify Community Forum\n\nWe‚Äôre launching the Apify Community Forum ‚Äì the place to connect with fellow developers, get quick answers, and see how others are using Apify!\n\n### What is the Apify Community Forum?\n\nIt‚Äôs a space to ask questions, share insights, and stay updated on the latest Apify news. Whether you need a solution to a problem or want to learn how others are using Apify in their daily workflows, you‚Äôll find what you need here.\n\n### Why join?\n\n  * **Find a buddy** : Collaborate with others and share tips.\n  * **Get answers** : Ask questions and get help from the community.\n  * **Learn from others** : Discover how people are using Apify and pick up best practices.\n  * **Stay updated** : Be the first to know about new features and updates.\n\n\n\n### Chat live on Discord\n\nFor real-time conversations, join our [Discord community](https://discord.apify.com/). It's the perfect place for quick interactions and instant feedback.\n\nJoin now and connect with other developers who are making the most of Apify!\n\nFilip Cicv√°rek\n\nSenior Product Manager\n\n* * *\n\nJan 24, 2025\n\n## [Submit and explore ideas for new Actors and integrations](/change-log/Submit-your-ideas)\n\nNew\n\nWeb\n\nWe‚Äôve launched the Ideas page! This feature allows users to submit ideas for Actors or We‚Äôve launched the **Ideas** page! This feature allows users to submit ideas for Actors or integrations they‚Äôd like to see on the Apify platform. It‚Äôs also a valuable resource for actor publishers who want to discover and prioritize solutions that meet real user demand.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\n  * **User-driven development** : Submit ideas for Actors or integrations you need, and let publishers and the Apify team know what matters to you.\n  * **Publisher insights** : Actor publishers can browse user suggestions to identify high-demand opportunities and create impactful solutions.\n\n\n\n**How it works:**\n\n  1. **Submit your idea** : Have a task you wish could be automated? Head to the Ideas page, describe your need, and submit it for consideration.\n  2. **Browse and vote** : Check out ideas submitted by other users, and vote for the ones you think should be prioritized.\n  3. **Publishers take action** : Actor publishers and the Apify team review ideas, focusing on the most requested ones to build useful Actors and integrations.\n\n\n\nüëâ [Learn more about how it works](https://apify.com/ideas/how-it-works)  \nüëâ [Submit your ideas or browse what‚Äôs trending](https://apify.com/ideas)\n\nYour ideas could shape the next must-have Actor‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss the chance to share!\n\nMathieux Barlow-Ladias\n\nProduct Manager\n\n* * *\n\nJan 6, 2025\n\n## [Validate with confidence and organize your integrations](/change-log/data-validation-and-integrations-screen)\n\nNew\n\nIntegrations\n\nConsole\n\n## New integrations space\n\nThe Integrations page is now available from the left navigation menu of Apify Console. This central location lets you view, access, and manage all your connected integrations in one place.\n\n‚≠ê **Why it matters:**\n\n  * [**Integrations are powerful**](https://console.apify.com/actors/aYG0l9s7dbB7j3gbS/integrations/options), and now they're easier to find. You can see all your configured integrations in Apify Console, understand the connections between Actors and their integrations, and manage your setup in one place.\n  * **Increase visibility** : We want make your integrations more accessible and easy to use. Integrations automate common tasks like data processing, email notifications, image downloads, and database uploads - tasks that would typically require manual work.\n\n\n\nIntegrate to get the most out of Apify!\n\nCheck out the [new integration space](https://console.apify.com/actors/integrations) üëâ\n\n## Introducing dataset validation - increase trust in your actors\n\nYou can now define dataset schemas in your Actor builds. This feature lets you monitor data at the field level and validate that your scraped data matches your specified format - helping both Apify team creators and users ensure data quality and completeness.\n\nüöÄ **Key features:**\n\n  * **Actor run alerts** : Dataset schemas in your Actor enable field-level alerts, letting you monitor specific data points to verify quality.\n  * **Run statistics** : During Actor runs, you'll see real-time statistics comparing valid and invalid results based on your dataset schema, giving you visibility into data quality as the Actor executes.\n  * **Dataset preview** : The upcoming dataset preview feature will show you the exact data structure each Actor returns, helping you quickly identify the right Actor for your needs.\n\n\n\nFor detailed guidance, refer to our [dataset schema documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/dataset-schema/validation).\n\nGriffin Trent\n\nSenior Product Manager\n\n* * *\n\nDec 18, 2024\n\n## [Take control of account and organization security with new safety features](/change-log/2FA-and-increased security)\n\nUpdate\n\nNew\n\nConsole\n\nWe've added new security features for accounts and organizations on Apify.\n\n**Here 's what's new:**\n\n## Two-factor authentication for account protection\n\nIf you use your email and password to sign in to Apify Console, you can now enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\n\nTo set up 2FA, visit your account settings and follow the configuration steps. See our [2FA documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/console/two-factor-authentication) for more information and detailed guidance.\n\n## Session length configuration\n\nNow, you have the ability to decide how long your account stays logged in. Set custom session durations based on your security requirements. Shorter sessions protect against unauthorized access, while longer sessions reduce authentication overhead in secured environments.\n\nSet your preferences in account settings.\n\n## **Set security requirements on organization members**\n\nSecurity is a team effort. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre introducing tools to help you ensure security best practices among all members of your organization.\n\n**Mandatory two-factor authentication:** Enforce that all members of your organization have 2FA enabled to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n**Session length limits:** Set maximum session durations for all members, providing added protection by requiring periodic re-authentication.\n\nHead over to the organization settings to set and enforce your preferred security standards.\n\nGriffin Trent\n\nSenior Product Manager\n\n* * *\n\nShow more changes\n\nWe're making the web more programmable.\n\nProduct\n\n  * [Apify Store](/store)\n\n  * [Integrations](/integrations)\n\n  * [Proxy](/proxy)\n\n  * [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n  * [Documentation](https://docs.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Code templates](/templates)\n\n  * [Deploy to Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment)\n\n  * [API reference](https://docs.apify.com/api)\n\n  * [Get paid on Apify](/partners/actor-developers)\n\n\n\n\nConsulting\n\n  * [Professional Services](/professional-services)\n\n  * [Apify Partners](/partners)\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n  * [Help & Support](https://help.apify.com/en/)\n\n  * [Submit your ideas](/ideas)\n\n  * [Forum](https://discord.apify.com/)\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n  * [About Apify](/about)\n\n  * [Contact us](/contact)\n\n  * [Events](https://lu.ma/apify)\n\n  * [Blog](https://blog.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Become an affiliate](/partners/affiliate)\n\n  * [Customer stories](/success-stories)\n\n  * [Changelog](/change-log)\n\n  * [JobsWe're hiring!](/jobs)\n\n\n\n\n[](/)\n\nSocials\n\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apifytech/)\n  * [](https://x.com/apify)\n  * [](https://github.com/apify)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/apify)\n  * [](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU)\n  * [](https://www.tiktok.com/@apifytech)\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n  * [](https://docs.apify.com/legal/gdpr-information)\n  * [](https://trust.apify.com/)\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n  * [](https://www.getapp.com/business-intelligence-analytics-software/a/apify/)\n  * [](https://www.softwareadvice.com/data-extraction/apify-profile/)\n  * [](https://www.capterra.com/p/150854/Apify/)\n  * [](https://www.g2.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://www.trustradius.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://crozdesk.com/software/apify)\n\n\n\n[Loading status...](https://status.apify.com/)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://docs.apify.com/legal/general-terms-and-conditions)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/privacy-policy)\n\n[Cookie Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/cookie-policy)\n\nCookie settings\n\n¬© 2025 Apify\n"
