They're always quick to help, super flexible, and really get what I'm trying to do. With their support, I've taken a simple concept and turned it into a money-making web scraper. They've got my back when it comes to publishing and answering questions. Being part of Apify feels like having a powerhouse team behind me, helping me turn ideas into real cash and aiding others to pull data they need. Can't recommend them enough!”\n\nJonathan Larson\n\nDeveloper\n\n“Apify helps users to extract data from websites that do not have a REST API, automate tasks that involve interacting with web pages, and scale up web scraping and automation projects with cloud infrastructure and proxies. Users can save time and money by using pre-existing actors in Apify Store or building their own with open-source tools. They can also get reliable and structured data from any website without getting blocked, connect to hundreds of apps with ready-made integrations or custom webhooks and API, and share their actors with other developers and earn money.”\n\nMuhammad Azlan\n\nFounder\n\n“The ease of creating Actors on Apify isn't just limited to the initial setup. The platform continues to impress during subsequent stages as well. Once the Actor is crafted, the process of deploying it is seamless, ensuring that my code runs efficiently without the need for extensive configurations. This convenience drastically reduces the time and effort required to get a scraping or automation task up and running.”\n\nAbdurrachman M.\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nThese companies could be your customers\n\n## Apify open source fair share\n\nApify will support and reward every open-source project on Apify Store. Just turn your code into an Actor and choose your reward tier.\n\n[Join the program](/partners/open-source-fair-share)\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### Why should I develop on Apify?\n\nApify was built by developers, for developers. Developing on Apify can help you gain passive income simply by publishing your code in a form of an Actor to Apify Store. We will help you find customers, promote your Actor, take care of scaling, computing and all the other technicalities so you don't have to worry about infrastructure. Read the [blog post](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/) from our CEO Jan Čurn that talks about why we launched this initiative.\n\n### Where can I ask other Apify developers for advice?\n\nOur [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU) is the perfect place for discussing anything Apify-related. You can talk to other developers or even [become a freelancer](https://apify.com/partners/freelancers) and offer custom solutions to customers!\n\n### What Actor should I build?\n\nOur [ideas page](https://apify.com/ideas) can be a great source of inspiration! Users can publish or upvote their ideas until a developer takes ownership and turns the idea into a full-fledged Actor. If you are interested in building one of these Actors, send us an email to [ideas@apify.com](mailto:ideas@apify.com) so we can reserve it for you.\n\n### What if an Actor I want to build already exists in Store?\n\nApify Store is just like any other marketplace. We believe that competition helps developers thrive and improve upon their code, especially when there are similar scrapers on the horizon! So, you can still build the Actor, but try to be imaginative when it comes to its set of features.\n\n### What are the terms and conditions of the Paid Actor initiative?\n\nYou can find the full terms and conditions you'd need to agree to when publishing your Paid Actor [here](https://apify.com/store-terms-and-conditions)\n\nHave more questions?\n\n## Start developing on Apify now!\n\n[Sign up for free](https://console.apify.com/sign-up)\n\nProduct\n\n  * [Apify Store](/store)\n\n  * [Integrations](/integrations)\n\n  * [Proxy](/proxy)\n\n  * [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n  * [Documentation](https://docs.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Code templates](/templates)\n\n  * [Deploy to Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment)\n\n  * [API reference](https://docs.apify.com/api)\n\n  * [Get paid on Apify](/partners/actor-developers)\n\n\n\n\nConsulting\n\n  * [Professional Services](/professional-services)\n\n  * [Apify Partners](/partners)\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n  * [Help & Support](https://help.apify.com/en/)\n\n  * [Submit your ideas](/ideas)\n\n  * [Forum](https://discord.apify.com/)\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n  * [About Apify](/about)\n\n  * [Contact us](/contact)\n\n  * [Events](https://lu.ma/apify)\n\n  * [Blog](https://blog.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Become an affiliate](/partners/affiliate)\n\n  * [Customer stories](/success-stories)\n\n  * [Changelog](/change-log)\n\n  * [JobsWe're hiring!](/jobs)\n\n\n\n\n[](/)\n\nSocials\n\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apifytech/)\n  * [](https://x.com/apify)\n  * [](https://github.com/apify)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/apify)\n  * [](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU)\n  * [](https://www.tiktok.com/@apifytech)\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n  * [](https://docs.apify.com/legal/gdpr-information)\n  * [](https://trust.apify.com/)\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n  * [](https://www.getapp.com/business-intelligence-analytics-software/a/apify/)\n  * [](https://www.softwareadvice.com/data-extraction/apify-profile/)\n  * [](https://www.capterra.com/p/150854/Apify/)\n  * [](https://www.g2.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://www.trustradius.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://crozdesk.com/software/apify)\n\n\n\n[Loading status...](https://status.apify.com/)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://docs.apify.com/legal/general-terms-and-conditions)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/privacy-policy)\n\n[Cookie Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/cookie-policy)\n\nCookie settings\n\n© 2025 Apify\n"
