Our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU) is always here to help!\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What is web scraping and how can it help me with market research?\n\nIf you were to do market research prices manually, you'd probably have to pay a lot of money (typically more than $15,000) for a custom industry report or collect data online yourself. Then you would need to put it into a structured database or even just an Excel spreadsheet. Web scraping does this job for you and creates datasets of structured data from the web pages that you point it to. Scraping is essential if you want to do market research at scale and it will save you an immense amount of time.\n\n### Is it legal to scrape data for market research?\n\nIt is legal to scrape publicly available data such as product descriptions, prices, or ratings. On the other hand, certain types of data, such as personal data or copyrighted content, are under special legal protection and you should not scrape these without first making sure you follow the relevant laws and regulations. Read through our blog post on the [web scraping legality](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/) to learn more about the law and extracting data from the web. Web scraping for market research is specfically permitted in the European Union by the [DSM directive](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/#data-mining-in-the-european-union).\n\n### I couldn’t find a scraper for my specific website. Can I build it?\n\nKnock yourself out! Our platform was built to host and run thousands of scrapers. You can customize a [universal Web Scraper](https://apify.com/store/scrapers/universal-web-scrapers) or start a new one with some of our [ready-made templates](https://apify.com/templates) in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript. You can keep the scraper to yourself or make it public by adding it to Apify Store (and even make a [little cash](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/) out of it). You can also [integrate](https://apify.com/integrations) your scraper with other popular data processing services such as Keboola, Airbyte, or Zapier.\n\n### I don’t need to download scraped data. Is there an API I can use instead?\n\nYes, there is. You can have programmatic access to any scraper on the platform via Apify's web scraping API. It is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints and can be accessed either by using Python or Node.js clients, or manually. This API will enable you to fetch results directly from any of your datasets. Check out the [Apify API reference docs](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) for full details.\n\n### I'm not a developer. Can you build a custom market research scraper for me?\n\nSure! We can build you a [custom web scraper](https://apify.com/contact-sales/custom-web-scraper) or, if you're searching for a more affordable solution, get an external developer to create the scraper for you via our [Apify freelancer program](https://apify.com/partners/freelancers).\n\n### I don’t need scrapers for market research, but I know somebody who does. Can I refer them?\n\nYes. Our affiliate program offers up to 50% recurring commission for its participants.
