Don't take our word for it, check what our customers have to say about us and why Apify is the best web scraping and automation platform on the market.\n\n[](https://www.g2.com/products/apify/reviews)[](https://www.capterra.com/p/150854/Apify/reviews)\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### Can I advertise using a direct link?\n\nYes, after registration, you'll receive unique referral links that you can share with your audience. You can also customize these links to your liking.\n\n### Can I refer enterprise customers that require custom solution?\n\nYes you can! We can pay up to $2,000 per closed-won customer + a recurring commission from the subscription. For these referrals, you can send introductions to [sales@apify.com](mailto:sales@apify.com) directly or refer them to our [Enterprise services](https://apify.com/custom-solutions).\n\n### What is the commission payment period?\n\nCommissions are paid out of subscriptions via PayPal or bank transfer at the beginning of each month. You'll need to fill in your information in First Promoter before we can send you your earnings.\n\n### What is the minimum payout amount?\n\nThe minimum payout is $49, but we can make some exceptions. Please note that for any payout below $49 we will need you to send us an invoice.\n\n### Can I receive my commission via PayPal?\n\nYes.\n\n### How do I get my payout?\n\nYou’ll receive a regular email update with your accumulated earnings. When you are ready to withdaw your earnings, you can reply to that email and we will process your request. You can also exchange your earnings for Apify credits, in such case your earnings would be increased by another 15%, so for $100 in commission earnings you'd be able to get $115 in Apify credits.\n\n### What's the commission cap per customer? \n\nYou can earn up to $2,500 per each customer you refer to us. There is no time limit on the commission, so if you refer a customer that will take months or possibly years to reach this cap, you'd be getting the commission during this whole period as well.\n\n### Can I advertise Apify on Google Search myself?\n\nNo, any advertising activities and/or promotions using Google Ads/Adwords, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, LinkedIn Ads or any similar online marketing tool that either uses a policy based on or derived from pay-per-click marketing tools, is strictly prohibited and can lead to the termination of your account. Also please note that from August 2023, all referrals via paid search campaigns are blocked automatically by the system and hence you won't even see these referrals on your dashboard.\n\n### How much do your affiliate partners earn on average? \n\nEarnings among our affiliate partners can vary widely from a couple hundreds to thousands of dollars per month because it's really up to you and how actively you promote Apify. We set no upper earning limits—the sky's the limit! Well, almost: the maximum payout per customer is capped at $2,500. Beyond that, your earning potential is truly in your hands. The more you promote Apify, the more you stand to earn. It's that simple!\n\n### What types of promotional materials are provided? \n\nYou will get access to a full package of different banners, images, logos, badges and links that you can use in your campaigns. If there are more materials that might help you, just send us an email and we can discuss.\n\n## Referring an enterprise customer?\n\nOr perhaps you are a **top affiliate** and you're thinking of promoting Apify exclusively?
