processing, and AI agents. They are called Actors because, like human actors, they perform actions based on a script. They scale from simple tasks to complex workflows and integrate easily with APIs, databases, and AI models.\n\n[Browse pre-built Actors](/store)[Read the Actor whitepaper ](https://whitepaper.actor/)\n\nBenefits\n\n## Run locally or in the cloud\n\n###  Long-running serverless jobs\n\nApify Actors can perform time-consuming jobs that are longer than the lifespan of a single HTTP transaction.\n\n[Read the docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors)\n\n### Publish and monetize Actors\n\nJoin hundreds of developers who share their Actors on Apify Store and earn money from coding.\n\n[Go to Apify Store](/store)\n\n### Auto-generated user interface\n\nActors can easily define a user interface for their input configuration. Take advantage of lower-level features and settings, or run Actors using our API.\n\n[Learn about input schema](https://docs.apify.com/academy/deploying-your-code/input-schema)\n\n### Keep your Actor running\n\nYou can run Actors as real-time APIs with Actor Standby mode. It lets you keep the Actor ready in the background, waiting for incoming HTTP requests, just like a real-time web server or standard API server.\n\n[Learn more](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/standby)\n\nFeatures\n\n## Actors have you covered\n\n[**Integrations**   \nIntegrate your Actors with other systems. Connect Apify actors and tasks with your favorite web apps and cloud services.](integrations)[**Proxy**   \nImprove the performance of your web scrapers by smartly rotating datacenter and residential IP addresses.](proxy)[**Storage**   \nStore data from your Actors in one of our Apify storages: key-value stores, datasets, or request queues.](storage)\n\n## What else do Actors give you?\n\nHost code anywhere\n\nEdit your code on our platform, fetch from a Git repository, or push from your machine.\n\nDocker support\n\nActors run inside Docker containers on Apify servers. Use a custom Dockerfile.\n\nReady for scale\n\nRun as many Actors as you need. The Apify platform provisions the necessary resources.\n\nCustom memory and CPU\n\nAssign each Actor any RAM volume needed. CPU share is allocated automatically.\n\nCommand-line tool\n\nDevelop and test your Actors locally, push them to the Apify platform when you're ready.\n\nLogging\n\nView and download logs to debug your code and monitor performance on production.\n\n## Apify open source fair share\n\nApify will support and reward every open-source project on Apify Store. Just turn your code into an Actor and choose your reward tier.\n\n[Join the program](/partners/open-source-fair-share)\n\n## What are Actors?\n\nActors are lightweight, containerized programs that take JSON inputs, execute tasks, and return structured outputs. Inspired by UNIX philosophy, they offer a simple, composable approach to automation, web scraping, and AI workflows in the cloud.\n\n[Read the whitepaper ](https://whitepaper.actor/)\n\n## Ready to build your first Actor?\n\n[Start developing](/templates)\n\nProduct\n\n  * [Apify Store](/store)\n\n  * [Integrations](/integrations)\n\n  * [Proxy](/proxy)\n\n  * [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n  * [Documentation](https://docs.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Code templates](/templates)\n\n  * [Deploy to Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment)\n\n  * [API reference](https://docs.apify.com/api)\n\n  * [Get paid on Apify](/partners/actor-developers)\n\n\n\n\nConsulting\n\n  * [Professional Services](/professional-services)\n\n  * [Apify Partners](/partners)\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n  * [Help & Support](https://help.apify.com/en/)\n\n  * [Submit your ideas](/ideas)\n\n  * [Forum](https://discord.apify.com/)\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n  * [About Apify](/about)\n\n  * [Contact us](/contact)\n\n  * [Events](https://lu.ma/apify)\n\n  * [Blog](https://blog.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Become an affiliate](/partners/affiliate)\n\n  * [Customer stories](/success-stories)\n\n  * [Changelog](/change-log)\n\n  * [JobsWe're hiring!](/jobs)\n\n\n\n\n[](/)\n\nSocials\n\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apifytech/)\n  * [](https://x.com/apify)\n  * [](https://github.com/apify)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/apify)\n  * [](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU)\n  * [](https://www.tiktok.com/@apifytech)\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n  * [](https://docs.apify.com/legal/gdpr-information)\n  * [](https://trust.apify.com/)\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n  * [](https://www.getapp.com/business-intelligence-analytics-software/a/apify/)\n  * [](https://www.softwareadvice.com/data-extraction/apify-profile/)\n  * [](https://www.capterra.com/p/150854/Apify/)\n  * [](https://www.g2.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://www.trustradius.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://crozdesk.com/software/apify)\n\n\n\n[Loading status...](https://status.apify.com/)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://docs.apify.com/legal/general-terms-and-conditions)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/privacy-policy)\n\n[Cookie Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/cookie-policy)\n\nCookie settings\n\n© 2025 Apify\n"
