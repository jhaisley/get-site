You can rely on them to be consistent and reliable, so you’ll always be dealing with the same friendly faces who know your project inside out.\n\nMonitoring and maintenance\n\nOur automated monitoring system checks for data quality, completion, and delivery confirmation, while the maintenance package means that our team will fix issues quickly.\n\nFlexible integrations\n\nApify can be easily plugged into your existing workflows, using ready-made integrations with Zapier, Make, Google, and many other services.

We'll gladly help you to onboard your engineering team so you can retain full control of your solutions.\n\nWorld-class Apify experts\n\nOur team of experienced web scraping professionals can onboard your team and host workshops. We've been scraping for a long time and we love to share our knowledge.\n\nGreat documentation and onboarding\n\nWe'll help you understand how to get the most out of the Apify platform and provide in-depth documentation for your custom solution that your team can learn from and build on.\n\nMaximum privacy\n\nYou will get an NDA and details of your projects and data will never be shared with third parties. You will always have complete control over your datasets and solutions.\n\nExtremely scalable\n\nThe Apify platform can easily scale to hundreds of millions of web pages per month and terabytes of data. Our [new request queue](https://blog.apify.com/new-apify-request-queue/) comfortably handles up to 500,000 API requests every minute.\n\nSOC 2 compliance in progress\n\nWe are actively working towards SOC 2 certification to make sure that we meet all essential security standards by end-2024. Until then, we're more than happy to complete your security questionnaires.\n\n## How we deliver value to our clients\n\n[Actor bundles](https://blog.apify.com/apify-power-actors/) are a great example of the kind of projects we regularly complete for enterprise clients. Here's a diagram of a solution we prepared for the European Commission. The AI-powered Actor scrapes data from the product URLs of European online stores to monitor their pricing strategies. If a store is not complying with regulations, the authority is automatically notified. As of June 2024, Apify has helped the EU monitor more than 42,000 products from 740 e-retailers.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What does the SLA mean for my project?\n\nA service-level agreement (SLA) is essential to make sure both you and Apify are on the same page in terms of standards and service. By signing a service level agreement, we'll have a clearly documented method of working through our mutual expectations. For example, SLAs guarantee that we communicate discovered issues within a predetermined time, and we also guarantee to begin working on the solution within a set number of days or hours.\n\n### Do you support websites in different languages?\n\nYes, we can extract data and automate workflows on websites in any language. We can also extract data from mobile apps.\n\n### Can we migrate the solution to our own infrastructure?\n\nYou will own the intellectual property rights to the custom delivered software. The solutions are typically built using the open-source Apify SDK and other open-source libraries and tools, which can run on any computer outside the Apify platform. So it is definitely possible to migrate your solutions from the Apify platform to your own infrastructure.\n\n### How much will it cost?\n\nThe exact pricing depends on a number of factors, such as the number and complexity of target websites, amount of blocking, data volumes, SLA parameters, etc. Simply send us the details of your project and our team will provide you with an estimate.   \n  \nPlease note that our fully managed Enterprise solutions start at $2,000 per month. For more affordable ways to order custom solutions, please check out [Apify Partners](https://apify.com/partners/freelancers).\n\n### Can you maintain an existing web scraping project for us?\n\nYes. We are also able to help with the migration of existing scrapers to Apify and can manage your web scraping infrastructure.\n\n### What does the typical process look like?\n\nAfter submitting your request, a member of our team will contact you to discuss your project in more detail. The next step is that we will prepare a proposal for you detailing all the deliverables, timeline and associated costs. After you approve the proposal, we will prepare an agreement to finalize the details. Once signed, development of your solution will start. The solution will be delivered in the form of one or more [Actors](https://apify.com/actors) on the Apify platform.\n\n### Is web scraping legal?\n\nWeb scraping is legal if you scrape data publicly available on the internet. However, some kinds of data are protected by international regulations, such as personal data, intellectual property, or confidential data. You can learn more in our blog post about the [legality of web scraping.](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/)   \n  \nBut rest assured that our legal experts will analyze your project and will provide you with guidance. Please note that Apify is a proponent of not only legal, but also ethical scraping that doesn't overburden the target sites.\n\n## Let's start working together\n\nGet in touch and we'll discuss your project.\n\n[Contact sales](/contact-sales/custom-web-scraper)\n\nProduct\n\n  * [Apify Store](/store)\n\n  * [Integrations](/integrations)\n\n  * [Proxy](/proxy)\n\n  * [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n  * [Documentation](https://docs.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Code templates](/templates)\n\n  * [Deploy to Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment)\n\n  * [API reference](https://docs.apify.com/api)\n\n  * [Get paid on Apify](/partners/actor-developers)\n\n\n\n\nConsulting\n\n  * [Professional Services](/professional-services)\n\n  * [Apify Partners](/partners)\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n  * [Help & Support](https://help.apify.com/en/)\n\n  * [Submit your ideas](/ideas)\n\n  * [Forum](https://discord.apify.com/)\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n  * [About Apify](/about)\n\n  * [Contact us](/contact)\n\n  * [Events](https://lu.ma/apify)\n\n  * [Blog](https://blog.apify.com/)\n\n  * [Become an affiliate](/partners/affiliate)\n\n  * [Customer stories](/success-stories)\n\n  * [Changelog](/change-log)\n\n  * [JobsWe're hiring!](/jobs)\n\n\n\n\n[](/)\n\nSocials\n\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apifytech/)\n  * [](https://x.com/apify)\n  * [](https://github.com/apify)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/apify)\n  * [](https://discord.com/invite/jyEM2PRvMU)\n  * [](https://www.tiktok.com/@apifytech)\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n  * [](https://docs.apify.com/legal/gdpr-information)\n  * [](https://trust.apify.com/)\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n  * [](https://www.getapp.com/business-intelligence-analytics-software/a/apify/)\n  * [](https://www.softwareadvice.com/data-extraction/apify-profile/)\n  * [](https://www.capterra.com/p/150854/Apify/)\n  * [](https://www.g2.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://www.trustradius.com/products/apify/reviews)\n  * [](https://crozdesk.com/software/apify)\n\n\n\n[Loading status...](https://status.apify.com/)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://docs.apify.com/legal/general-terms-and-conditions)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/privacy-policy)\n\n[Cookie Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/cookie-policy)\n\nCookie settings\n\n© 2025 Apify\n"
